Search Engine
=============
After reading [Improving the performance of full-text search](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/09/improving-the-performance-of-full-text-search/) on the [DropBox Blog](https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/) (which is an excellent insight into the company) I was inspired to try building my own simple search engine.

To build on last year's object oriented module, I'm going to implement this in Java.

Aims
----
- Implement an Inverted Index algorithm
- Measure performance
